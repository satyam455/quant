so initialize vault Account is like 
say a user came and open intialize a vault or in simple terms in open a account in a bank,
their he give some initial money like 500 rupees to open a account and he is a payer
so 
user = user A
vault = the passbook he will be given to account his balance/credit/debit
usdt_mint = what is the money it is usd,rupee,eur etc , we are making this to be careful like it is the usdt we are depositing into not any other token by checking symbol/decimal like properties
vault_token_account = like the atm card we are give though which we can withdraw amounts but wait now a days we can also put amount back into atm by atm cards so think about it to implement.
vault_authority =  who has the authority to use the account means who has the authority to use the atm card i.e; who knows the atm pin.
